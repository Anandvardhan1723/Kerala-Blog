    <h2>What is beautiful About Kerala ?</h2>
    <p>Kerala is also known for its beautiful hill stations. Some popular hill stations to visit include Munnar, Wayanad, and Thekkady. Take a walk through the tea plantations, enjoy the cool mountain air, and take in the beautiful views of the surrounding landscape. Kerala is also known for its beautiful temples and palaces.<br/>Named as one of the ten paradises of the world by National Geographic Traveler, Kerala is one of the prominent tourist destinations of India, with coconut-lined sandy beaches, backwaters, hill stations, Ayurvedic tourism and tropical greenery as its major attractions.Agriculture contributes most to the state’s income in the primary sector. Kerala’s major sources of exports are agro-based like coir and cashew as well as marine products and manpower. In spices, pepper is the single most important product, with Kerala being the largest producer and exporter of black pepper. Cardamom and ginger are also exported.<br/>According to a legend the state of Kerala came up from beneath the sea, when the warrior sage Parashurama threw his axe here. The scriptures say that, Parashurama appealed to the gods to atone him from his previous sins, and he received two boons, from Varuna, the God of the Oceans and Bhumidevi, the Goddess of earth. He proceeded to Kanyakumari, and threw his axe northwards, and the land that rose from the sea where the axe fell was called the land of Parashurama. Another theory suggests that the enormous amount of silt that the rivers of Kerala deposit from the hills to the sea is washed up to the shore.</p>
